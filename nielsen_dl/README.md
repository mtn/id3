These are notes and implementations from my reading of Michael Nielsen's [neural networks book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

I originally planned to just do implementations in rust, but after spending too much time reading documentation trying to figure out libraries, I've decided to first implement in python.
